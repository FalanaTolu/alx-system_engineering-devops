# Documentation for Project 0x02-shell_redirections



**This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects**



This project was about how to use redirection in the Linux environment.



It showed what the commands *head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr* do.



It also showed how to redirect standard output to a file, how to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard, how to send the output from one program to the input of another program and how to combine commands and filters with redirections.


This project also dealt with special characters. It gave an understanding of what the *white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, tilde* mean and how
and when to use them.
